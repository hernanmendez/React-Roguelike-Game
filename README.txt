When you go to js/precomp.js and you watch the Render method of the component Game
you'll notice there are a lot of divs that are mostly areas I used to put inputs
that get the values needed to perfom modifications on the Level
and then you find a big blank space
I did that because it's the sign that those Divs Ended but there is the exception of the 
AddArea Div
